# vst3cpptest

Gain plugin example following Steinbergs official docs & tutorial.

The goal is to build out the basic parts of a VST3 plugin (parameters, event handling, GUI) and to remove as many Steinberg helper classes as possible, maintaining only the official plugin wrapper. When this point is reached, the whole repo will be ported to C and use Steinbergs official C SDK.
